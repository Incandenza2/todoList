Very simple app for creating and crossing tasks.


As soon as it opens it must show the tasks already set for the day. There should be a system for tasks that are set daily, or through a day of the week thing.
The default "project" should be called "Today". Have a really quick and accessible little thing to type and queue a task *for tomorrow* with a single click, and otherwise a button for a menu to define a periodic task.

Will utilize local storage to stay permanent on the device. Ideal to set up as browser homepage.
